abstract = {Photographing images is used as a common detection tool during the process of bridge maintenance. The edges in an image can provide a lot of valuable information, but the detection and extraction of edge details are often affected by the image noise. This study proposes an algorithm for wavelet transform to denoise the image before edge detection, which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the image and retain as much edge information as possible. In this study, four wavelet functions and four decomposition levels are used to decompose the image, filter the coefficients and reconstruct the image. The PSNR and MSE of the denoised images were compared, and the results showed that the sym5 wavelet function with three-level decomposition has the best overall denoising performance, in which the PSNR and MSE of the denoised images were 23.48 dB and 299.49, respectively. In this study, the canny algorithm was used to detect the edges of the images, and the detection results visually demonstrate the difference between before and after denoising. In order to further evaluate the denoising performance, this study also performed edge detection on images processed by both wavelet transform and the current widely used Gaussian filter, and it calculated the Pratt quality factor of the edge detection results, which were 0.53 and 0.47, respectively. This indicates that the use of wavelet transform to remove noise is more beneficial to the improvement of the subsequent edge detection results.},

With that in mind, Introduction to Digital Image Processing is simpler in terms of mathematical derivations and eliminates derivations of advanced subjects. Most importantly, the textbook contains an extensive set of programming exercises for students.The textbook examines the basic technologies needed to support image processing applications, including the characterization of continuous images, image sampling and quantization techniques, and two-dimensional signal processing techniques. It then covers the two principle areas of image processing: image enhancement and restoration techniques and extraction of information from an image. It concludes with discussions of image and video compression.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge. This detection scheme uses several elongated operators at each point, and the directional operator outputs are integrated with the gradient maximum detector.}

It is shown that as long as the video content and the codec type are not changed, PSNR is a valid quality measure. However, when the content is changed, correlation between subjective quality and PSNR is highly reduced. Hence PSNR cannot be a reliable method for assessing the video quality across different video contents. }

abstract = {This paper firstly presents a study of video quality for H.264 compressed videos compared to MPEG-4 (simple profile) from a perceptual point of view. Traditionally, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) has been used to represent the quality of a compressed video sequence. However, PSNR has been found to correlate poorly with subjective quality ratings, particularly at much lower bitrates and low frame rates. Thus, an alternative that has been commonly used is to perform subjective test where a large number of human subjects are used to gauge the quality of a video. However, this process is not only time-consuming but also tedious and expensive to perform. Hence, this paper further proposes an objective video quality measurement method to automatically measure the perceptual quality of a stream of video images. The proposed method has been tested on multimedia videos, consisting of CIF and QCIF video sequences compressed at various bitrates (24–384kbps) and frame rates (7.5–30fps) using the H.264 and MPEG-4 video codecs and it is shown to give significantly better correlations to the human perception than PSNR and the video structural similarity method.}

abstract = {The image edges is the most fundamental features and carries most of the information in the image. It is also one of the most important research topics in image processing. However, real images are generally contaminated by noise. Therefore, it is important to consider how to eliminate the interference caused by noise while ensuring the precision of the detected edges. This paper proposes a noise robust edge detection algorithm based on wavelet transform and convolutional neural network. Firstly, the noise in images is suppressed with wavelet transform and threshold denoising in the wavelet domain. Secondly, rich local features are further extracted suing residual dense modules to eliminate redundant noise-induced background clutter. Lastly, the edge detection module integrates multi-scale features in the hierarchical network and iteratively improves the output edge map through deep supervision. The experimental results on the BSDS500 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. Compared with the typical methods, The poposed method achieves higher quality edges under different noise levels and has strong generalization ability.},

abstract = {In almost all digital data processing machine applications, the input data made available to the machine are the result of some prior processing. This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images.},

HED automatically learns rich hierarchical representations (guided by deep supervision on side responses) that are important in order to resolve the challenging ambiguity in edge and object boundary detection. We significantly advance the state-of-the-art on the BSDS500 dataset (ODS F-score of 0.790) and the NYU Depth dataset (ODS F-score of 0.746), and do so with an improved speed (0.4 s per image) that is orders of magnitude faster than some CNN-based edge detection algorithms developed before HED.

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images.},
